# Logic_Gate_Simulator
GUI to draw logic gate circuit and run.

Name : Ms. Sayali Sambhaji Salunke

MIS ID : 111403040

Description of the work done : 

> Program allows to draw a simple combinational circuit on the screen using toolbox.

> It opens a new window named as Logic Gate Simulator containing toolbox, 
using the components in it, circuit can be drawn below it.

> All the handling is done using mouse, significant mouse movements are stored.

> Then permanently stored in the final data structure and also in the structure 
that helps in drawing screen at every instant.

> When DONE is pressed, a procedure executes which creates stack for each
led containig pointers pointing to all the components that determine value of 
the led, components are stored in LED TO SWITCH direction.

> And hence circuit is traced, value at particular led is calculated.

> Corresponding changes are made to the data structures. 

> RESET allows cleaning up the field.
